# p2_solution_2

Our solution for p2.

Steps for our program:

To start the project you should navigate to the ‘server’ folder and enter node server.js. The first page is login page, you can enter your username and password or create a new user when you navigate to the sign up page. After logging in, you go to your group page, where you can see your groups, create a new one or check whether you have received an invitation. On the general post page you can write a post, search for specific posts (title and tags) and/or like, dislike and pin a post. On the right side after clicking on the profile icon, various options appears, including team cohesion, calendar, whiteboard room, and questions for team cohesion. There is also a reminder on the post page where you can give a time and then it will remind you when the time is up.

But this version is only a backup and to try new things, so there are functions and documents which are not present in our final repository P2_SOLUTION
